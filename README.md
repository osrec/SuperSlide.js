<img src='gifs/demo.gif' width='200'>

This library aims to provide a highly configurable, ready-to-use sliding menu for your next web application, while delivering native-like animation performance. It was created by the [OSREC Technologies](https://`OSREC.co.uk) while developing [Bx, our invoicing, time-tracking and project management PWA](https://usebx.com).

# Installation

```
npm install superslide.js
```

# Usage

Reference the library in a script tag
```html
<script src='superslide.js'></script>
```
Add basic HTML markup
```html
<body>
  <div id='content'>Content</div>
  <div id='menu'>Menu</div>
</body>
```
Add styles (so we can see what's going on!)
```html
<style>
  body     { padding: 0px; margin: 0px; }
  #menu    { background: #ccc; }
  #content { min-height: 100vh; min-width: 100vw; }
</style>
```
Initialise the menu
```js
var myMenu = new OSREC.superslide
({
    slider: document.getElementById('menu'),
    content: document.getElementById('content'),
    animation: 'slideLeft'
});

// Promise resolves once menu is open
var openPromise = myMenu.open();
```
